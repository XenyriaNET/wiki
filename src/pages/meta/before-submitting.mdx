# Before Submitting

After you've done your changes and are ready to submit them, make sure to complete the following steps:

- If you've added content to a page that was currently empty (Only contained a heading and the `<Soon />` element), remove it from the [Missing Pages](/meta/missing-pages) page. This can be found under `src/pages/meta/missing-pages.mdx`.
