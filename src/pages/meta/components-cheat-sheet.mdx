# Components Cheat Sheet

Since Xenyria uses MD<u>**X**</u> instead of normal MD, it supports React components.

If they contain content, they can be used like `<Component>Content</Component>`, if they don't, they can be used like `<Component />`.

## Components

### `<Info>Content</Info>`

Displays an info box.

<Info>
...which would look like this! :)
</Info>

### `<Stub />`

Displays a warning saying that the page below is a stub. It's used on pages that are not finished yet or are just not very complete.

Should be placed **above** the heading.

<Stub />

### `<Soon />`

Displays a warning saying that the page below is coming soon. It's used on pages that don't have any content yet.

Should be placed **below** the heading and be the only thing on the page (except for the heading).

<Soon />
