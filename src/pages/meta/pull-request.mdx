# Pull Request

Remember how we created that fork which is your own copy of the Wiki? Well, now we want to merge our changes back into the original Wiki. This is done by creating a pull request. A pull request is a request to merge your changes into the original repository.

## 1. Initiate a Pull Request

On your forked repository, click on the `Pull Requests` tab and then click on the `New Pull Request` button.

## 2. Make sure the branches are correct

Next up, make sure that:

- The `base repository` (1) is `XenyriaNET/xenyria-wiki`
- The `base` (2) is `main`
- The `head repository` (3) is your own fork
- The `compare` (4) is the branch you're working on. Unless you created a custom branch as described on [Additional Info](/meta/additional-info.md), this will be `main`

If all of this is correct, click on the `Create pull request` button.

## 3. Describe your changes

Now, you'll be taken to a page where you can describe your changes. This is optional, but it's recommended to describe what you've changed. This will help us understand what you've changed and why you've changed it.

## 4. Create the pull request

Once you've described your changes, click on the `Create pull request` button. This will create the pull request and notify us of your changes. We'll review your changes and merge them into the Wiki if they're good.

<Info>
  If you're a member of the XenyriaNET organization, you can merge your own pull
  requests. If you're not a member, you'll have to wait for a member to review
  your changes and merge them.
