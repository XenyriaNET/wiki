### Make your changes

Now you can make your changes to the file.

You can use both Markdown as well as a selection of React Components. To find more about what you can do using Markdown read our [Markdown Cheat Sheet](/meta/markdown-cheat-sheet) and to find out more about React Components, read our [Components Cheat Sheet](/meta/components-cheat-sheet).

Also make sure to follow our [Writing Guidelines](/meta/writing-guidelines) to make sure your changes are consistent with the rest of the documentation.

### Preview your changes

Using the preview tab at the top, you can see what your changes will look like once they're published. This is a great way to make sure your changes look good before you publish them.

Please note however that React Components will not render in the preview.

### Commit your changes

Once you're happy with your changes, click the "Commit changes..." button in the top right (1)

Then, enter a short but descriptive commit message about your changes (2) and optionally a more detailed longer extended description (3)

Next, make sure you're comitting to the active branch. (4) This would normally be main, unless you created a custom branch as described on the [Additional Info](/meta/additional-info) page.

Lastly, click "Propose changes" (5)
