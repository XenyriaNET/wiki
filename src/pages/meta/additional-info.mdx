## Changes after creating a Pull Request

If you do further changes on the same branch of your fork and still have an open, unmerged pull request, all changes will be part of that Pull Request.

This is useful for when you e.g. noticed a mistake in your changes and want to fix it.

However, if you want to do new contributions, you should not do this. There's two options you have:

1. Wait until your Pull Request has been merged and then do any new changes.
2. Create a new branch for your new changes. A branch is like a copy of the fork. For simplicity, this will not be described on here, but you can find countless guides online.

## Updating your fork

If you forked the repository a while ago, it might be outdated. To update it, you need to click the "Sync Fork" button on the top of your fork's page.
